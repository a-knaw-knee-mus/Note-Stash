# Note Stash
- Note taking web app created using the MERN stack, with Google Oauth2.0 for customized notes for each user.
- Since it uses Google Oauth for authentication, no passwords or sensitive information are saved on our end

## Upcoming Features
- Hash messages on the database for increased security
- Ability to edit notes
- Add a real-time visual for the letter limit so the user knows when their note is too large (make the text red when the limit is exceeded)
- Ability to add images to a note
- Ability to export notes to a .txt/.json file
